======================

What are the chances of plummeting into the ravine if these people stumble drunkenly home over the bridge? A [processing.js visualisation](http://processingjs.org/) of cumulative random walks.

It makes a simple point that, for example, some climate 'skeptics' seem to make a lot of fuss about: an individual's random walk across a bridge is uncertain, true. But uncertainty, if you have enough data, can produce completely bomb-proof predictability. In this case, we could tell these drunkards they're about 60% likely to plummet to their deaths before reaching the other side. They might want to consider going to a different pub. Galton had a cool thing to say about this predictability:
			
<em>"I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the “Law of Frequency of Error”. The law would have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known of it. It reigns with serenity and in complete self-effacement, amidst the wildest confusion. The huger the mob, and the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason. Whenever a large sample of chaotic elements are taken in hand and marshalled in the order of their magnitude, an unsuspected and most beautiful form of regularity proves to have been latent all along."</em>
